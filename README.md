# Blazesoft Library

## **Requirements**

1. `npm` for running the scripts

2. Make sure that npm is installed

## **Getting Started**

### **Running the app locally**

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leanjunio/blazesoft
```

2. Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run on `dev` should start the `next dev` script

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Next.js should automatically open your default browser and navigation to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and render the 3 default books

## Considerations made

The Book Title was created with a button to keep the semantic meaning behind the intended action when the title is clicked. Making it a link was not feasable since the page doesn't go anywhere and making it just a hoverable text to be clicked did not feel like it calls the user's attention.
